    <h1>Owning a Snake</h1>
    <p>
      I'm an individual who definitely goes outside the norm with what I want as a pet.
      While other people would say dogs or cats; I say snakes.  Snakes have been a passion
      of mine for so long and I absoluely love them.  So when I found out you can legally
      own certain snakes I was ecstatic.  So I made the plan to do my research and own one.

    <h3>Choosing the Snake</h3>
    <p>
      Snakes are very particular when it comes to care.  there isn't really an easy to
      follow set of rules since so snakes are so picky.  But with enough research and
      crossreferencing to find similar ideas, I settled on the corn snake as a great
      starter snake.
